# About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the BDSC Lab under Prof. Philip S. Yu's supervision. My research interests are data mining, data-centric AI (data generating and learning), and domain adaptation (federated learning, pre-training, and fast adaptation), with most applications to recommender systems (sequential, graph, and knowledge graph recommendations).
