<!-- # About Me -->
I am currently an Applied Scientist in AWS AI Labs, working on personalization models research and advancement.
I earned my CS Ph.D. in the BDSC Lab of University of Illinois Chicago, under Prof. Philip S. Yu's supervision.

# Research Interests
My research studies how to **enhance information retrieval for search and recommendation**, particularly with large language models (LLMs), on **alleviating data issues (long-tail distribution and insufficient diversity) and multi-domains recommendation in both data and model perspectives**. This includes (but is not limited to) 
* Improved Transformers - ([WWW22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06035.pdf), 
[WWW23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12197.pdf), 
[BigData22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13572.pdf), 
[CIKM21](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06165.pdf)); 
* Long-tail uses/items by data augmentation and denoising - ([SIGIR21](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00522.pdf), 
[CIKM23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07633.pdf), 
[SIGIR23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03344.pdf)); 
* Representation collapse and diversity - ([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11986.pdf));
* Multi-domains recommendation with privacy - ([UAI23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03191.pdf), 
[TIST22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3501815)).
